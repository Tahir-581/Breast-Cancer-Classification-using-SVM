# Breast Cancer Classification using SVM

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classifying breast cancer based on the `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer` dataset. The project also includes data visualization using PCA, a feature correlation heatmap, and evaluation metrics like a confusion matrix and classification report.

## Features
- **SVM Classifier**: Trained with a linear kernel for binary classification.
- **Feature Correlation Heatmap**: Visualizes relationships between dataset features.
- **PCA for Data Visualization**: Reduces data to two dimensions for better interpretability.
- **Confusion Matrix & Classification Report**: Evaluates model performance.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.

```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
